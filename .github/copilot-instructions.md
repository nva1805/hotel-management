# Hotel Management Web Application

This is a Next.js application for managing a small hotel with features including:
- Room booking management
- Check-in/Check-out system
- Dashboard with room timeline view
- Customer management
- Billing and invoicing
- Reports and analytics

The application uses:
- Next.js with TypeScript and App Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management
- FullCalendar for timeline/scheduling views
- Headless UI for components
- Axios for API calls (with mock data for now)

The application is designed for a small hotel (10-30 rooms) where the manager also works as a receptionist.
